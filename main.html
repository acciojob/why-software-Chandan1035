	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
<p>
    I have always been fascinated by technology and how it can be used to solve complex problems. As a software developer, I would have the opportunity to create solutions that can make a real difference in people's lives. I am also drawn to the constantly evolving nature of the field, which allows for continual learning and growth.
    Additionally, I enjoy the challenge of breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces and finding creative solutions to them. I believe that becoming a developer would allow me to utilize my analytical and problem-solving skills, as well as my passion for technology.
